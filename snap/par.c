// snaprun.par: several programs run at once, each answered with its exit status.
//
// The arguments arrive as one string, every field on its own line: how many
// may run at once, how many gigabytes each was given, the directory they write
// into, and then each job as its argument count followed by that many
// arguments. A count before a job is what lets an argument hold anything a
// line may hold, so nothing has to invent a separator the way a `\x1e` between
// records would. No shell sees any of it.
//
// A child's output goes to `<at>/<n>` rather than down a pipe. One pipe a
// child would mean polling every one of them at once or deadlocking on
// whichever filled its buffer first, and a file is what the caller reads back
// anyway.
//
// The deadline is an absolute second, or 0 for none, and it is enforced here
// because here is where the queueing happens. A job bounded by what was left
// when the batch started is not bounded at all: with a width of four and
// thirty jobs, the last one starts long after that and still gets the whole
// window. So a job is skipped outright once the deadline has gone by, and one
// that does start carries an alarm set to what is actually left.
//
// A width of 0 means the caller has no opinion and this works one out. Cores
// are the obvious ceiling and the wrong one on their own: every one of these
// runs under a memory cap, so what the machine can hold divides the answer as
// surely as what it can compute. What it can hold is the memory going spare
// rather than the memory it has — the cap bounds what one job may take, so a
// width read off the total would happily start seven jobs entitled to more
// than the machine has left and leave the kernel to sort it out.
//
// Spare means MemAvailable, which is the kernel's own estimate of what a new
// job could get, page cache it would reclaim included. `sysinfo` has no field
// for it: its freeram plus bufferram omit Cached, so the width would be too
// small. sysinfo is still the fallback for a system with no /proc.
